# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive refactoring of the existing desktop-first KIRO application to implement a mobile-first, fluid, and accessible user interface. The rebuild will utilize CSS Modules for page and feature styles, styled-components for reusable primitives and component-local variants, a minimal design-tokens layer with CSS variables, and a small set of mixins for media/container queries, fluid typography, and spacing. The goal is to modernize the UI architecture while preserving KIRO branding and ensuring optimal user experience across all device sizes.

## Global Technical Preconditions

- The app SHALL include `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` without `user-scalable=no`
- Layout root containers SHALL respect device safe areas using `padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top)` and equivalent for left/right/bottom where content can be obscured, guarded with `@supports(padding: env(safe-area-inset-top))`
- A design-tokens file `tokens.css` SHALL define breakpoints, fluid type, spacing, radii, shadows, and color tokens and be imported once at app root
- Global color scheme SHALL advertise support with `color-scheme: light dark` and respect `prefers-color-scheme`
- Web fonts SHALL use `font-display: swap` (or optional) and a metric-compatible fallback to minimize CLS
- A skip link (e.g., "Skip to content") SHALL be present and visible on focus
- Zoom SHALL NOT be disabled in viewport meta tag

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the KIRO app to display properly on my phone screen, so that I can access all features without horizontal scrolling or layout issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is viewed at ≥360px width THEN the system SHALL render without horizontal scroll except for explicitly designated scrollable regions
2. WHEN base styles are defined THEN the system SHALL use mobile-first with progressive enhancement via @media (min-width: ...)
3. WHEN layout spacing is needed THEN the system SHALL prefer CSS gap over margins where a parent uses grid/flex
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use max-width: 100%, height: auto, object-fit: cover
5. WHEN media blocks are used THEN the system SHALL declare aspect-ratio or intrinsic ratio technique to prevent layout shift

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want consistent and fluid typography and spacing, so that the content is readable and well-proportioned across different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typography is rendered THEN the system SHALL use CSS variables with clamp() across a minimum of three steps (body, h2, h1)
2. WHEN spacing is applied THEN the system SHALL use a fluid scale via CSS variables and be applied consistently to sections/components
3. WHEN breakpoints are needed THEN the system SHALL use 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px with additional breakpoints justified in PR
4. WHEN fixed pixel widths/heights are used for layout THEN the system SHALL replace them with %, auto, minmax(), fr, or flex growth
5. WHEN absolute positioning is used for layout (not overlays/tooltips) THEN the system SHALL replace it with grid/flex alignment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating the app, I want a responsive header that adapts to my screen size, so that I can easily access navigation options regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen width is <768px THEN the system SHALL show logo + hamburger button with aria-controls and aria-expanded
2. WHEN screen width is ≥768px THEN the system SHALL show expanded inline navigation

4. WHEN Esc key is pressed on open menu THEN the system SHALL close menu and return focus to toggle button
5. WHEN navigation is provided THEN the system SHALL ensure no hover-only affordances and all actions are keyboard reachable
6. WHEN branding is displayed THEN the system SHALL match KIRO design tokens for logo, colors, and sizing
7. WHEN skip navigation is provided THEN the system SHALL include a visible 'Skip to content' link that is focusable from the header and lands on main element

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the app to meet accessibility standards, so that I can use the application effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN interactive targets are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure they are ≥44×44 CSS px
3. WHEN focus states are applied THEN the system SHALL provide visible focus rings that meet contrast and are not suppressed
4. WHEN page structure is rendered THEN the system SHALL include semantic landmarks: header, nav, main, footer
5. WHEN accessibility is evaluated THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.2 AA for color contrast, focus order, skip-to-content, no keyboard traps, and proper labels with aria-label/aria-labelledby

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a well-organized styling architecture, so that styles are maintainable and reusable across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page/feature styles are needed THEN the system SHALL use CSS Modules
2. WHEN reusable primitives are created THEN the system SHALL use styled-components
3. WHEN design tokens are defined THEN the system SHALL expose them in tokens.css with changes cascading without per-component edits
4. WHEN responsive utilities are needed THEN the system SHALL provide mixins.ts with media-query helpers, fluid type helper, focus ring, and touch target utilities
5. WHEN global styles are applied THEN the system SHALL import them once at app root with no duplicate global imports
6. WHEN components render in both narrow and wide contexts (e.g., Card, Table, Media rail) THEN the system SHALL opt into container queries using container-type: inline-size and style switches via @container rules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user viewing content on different devices, I want card grids and data layouts to adapt appropriately, so that information remains accessible and well-organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN card grids are displayed THEN the system SHALL use repeat(auto-fit, minmax(16rem, 1fr)) or equivalent responsive patterns
2. WHEN tables are viewed at <768px THEN the system SHALL either stack into "row cards" with headers/cells programmatically associated via id + aria-describedby (or th scope="row" pattern) OR provide horizontal scroll with sticky header maintaining min touch target ≥44×44 for sort/filter controls
3. WHEN layout containers are used THEN the system SHALL use max-width + auto centering with consistent inline padding
4. WHEN grid layouts are needed THEN the system SHALL use CSS Grid with responsive column definitions avoiding fixed column counts at all sizes
5. WHEN route transitions occur THEN the system SHALL avoid layout shifts using known heights, aspect ratios, or skeletons

### Requirement 7

6. WHEN initial load occurs THEN the system SHALL avoid large reflows using content-visibility: auto or skeletons for below-the-fold sections
7. WHEN LCP images are optimized THEN the system SHALL use fetchpriority="high" for exactly one LCP image per route with all other images defaulting to normal
8. WHEN third-party scripts are loaded THEN the system SHALL use defer or async and evaluate against LCP/INP budget
9. WHEN web fonts are loaded THEN the system SHALL specify font-display: swap (or optional) and use metric-compatible fallback stack to prevent CLS from font swaps
### 
Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with different input methods and device orientations, I want the app to work seamlessly with touch, keyboard, and mouse interactions, so that I can use my preferred input method effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
