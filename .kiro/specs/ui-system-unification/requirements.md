# UI System Unification Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the unification of the current hybrid styling system into a consistent, maintainable architecture using CSS Modules + Design Tokens + Cascade Layers. The goal is to eliminate styling inconsistencies, improve developer experience, and maintain the excellent accessibility and responsive design foundations while standardizing on a single styling approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Styling Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent styling system across all components, so that I can efficiently build and maintain UI components without confusion about which styling approach to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing any component THEN the system SHALL use CSS Modules as the primary styling method
2. WHEN styling components THEN all styles SHALL be based on existing design tokens (var(--color-*), var(--space-*), etc.)
3. WHEN organizing styles THEN the system SHALL maintain cascade layers (@layer reset, tokens, base, components, utilities)
4. WHEN creating new components THEN styled-components SHALL NOT be used for new development
5. WHEN reviewing code THEN all components SHALL have a consistent .module.css file structure

### Requirement 2: Elimination of Inline Styles

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all styling logic contained in CSS files, so that styles are maintainable, reusable, and follow architectural principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing component code THEN there SHALL be zero style={{...}} attributes in JSX
2. WHEN dynamic styling is needed THEN CSS custom properties SHALL be passed through component props
3. WHEN conditional styling is required THEN CSS classes with data attributes or CSS custom properties SHALL be used
4. WHEN migrating existing inline styles THEN all style logic SHALL be moved to corresponding .module.css files
5. WHEN building the application THEN ESLint SHALL prevent new inline styles from being introduced

### Requirement 3: Tokenized Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent responsive breakpoints and sizing, so that the application maintains visual consistency across all screen sizes and components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using media queries THEN custom media queries (@media (--bp-md)) SHALL be used instead of raw pixel values
2. WHEN defining component dimensions THEN fixed pixel widths SHALL be replaced with clamp() or container-relative units
3. WHEN creating responsive layouts THEN container queries SHALL be preferred over media queries where appropriate
4. WHEN sizing typography THEN fluid typography using clamp() SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN spacing elements THEN fluid spacing tokens SHALL be used consistently

### Requirement 4: Clean Directory Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a predictable file organization, so that I can quickly locate and maintain component styles without cross-layer dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN each component SHALL have its own .module.css file co-located with the component
2. WHEN organizing styles THEN page-specific CSS files SHALL be eliminated in favor of component-based styles
3. WHEN importing styles THEN cross-layer imports between styling systems SHALL be prohibited
4. WHEN structuring directories THEN src/components/ui SHALL contain design system components with consistent patterns
5. WHEN organizing features THEN src/features SHALL follow the same styling conventions as core components

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Linting and CI Integration

**User Story:** As a team, I want automated enforcement of styling standards, so that architectural violations are caught before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Stylelint THEN raw color values (hex codes) SHALL be flagged as errors
2. WHEN running Stylelint THEN !important declarations SHALL be flagged as warnings
3. WHEN running ESLint THEN inline style attributes SHALL be forbidden except for CSS custom properties
4. WHEN submitting PRs THEN CI SHALL block merges that contain styling violations
5. WHEN running linters THEN custom media query violations SHALL be detected and reported

### Requirement 6: Accessibility Standards Preservation

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the same high-quality accessible experience after the styling migration, so that the application remains usable for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN tokenized focus rings SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN updating styles THEN WCAG 2.2 AA compliant colors SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN refactoring responsive design THEN reduced-motion support SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN converting components THEN high contrast mode support SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN updating interactions THEN touch target requirements (44px minimum) SHALL be enforced

### Requirement 7: Performance and Modern CSS Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast-loading, performant styles that leverage modern CSS capabilities, so that the application feels responsive and modern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading styles THEN cascade layers SHALL optimize CSS parsing and application
2. WHEN using container queries THEN components SHALL be self-contained and context-aware
3. WHEN applying animations THEN CSS custom properties SHALL enable efficient dynamic styling
4. WHEN loading components THEN CSS Modules SHALL provide optimal bundle splitting
5. WHEN rendering layouts THEN modern CSS features (grid, flexbox, clamp) SHALL be utilized effectively

### Requirement 8: Migration Strategy and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear migration path from the current system, so that the transition is smooth and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating styled-components THEN equivalent CSS Module patterns SHALL be provided
2. WHEN converting inline styles THEN dynamic styling capabilities SHALL be preserved through CSS custom properties
3. WHEN updating components THEN existing component APIs SHALL remain unchanged where possible
4. WHEN refactoring styles THEN visual appearance SHALL be maintained exactly
5. WHEN completing migration THEN all existing functionality SHALL work without regression

### Requirement 9: Developer Experience Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved tooling and patterns, so that I can work more efficiently with the styling system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN consistent naming conventions SHALL be enforced
2. WHEN debugging styles THEN CSS Modules class names SHALL be readable in development
3. WHEN writing styles THEN TypeScript integration SHALL provide type safety for CSS Module imports
4. WHEN using design tokens THEN IDE autocomplete SHALL work for CSS custom properties
5. WHEN following patterns THEN clear examples and documentation SHALL be available

### Requirement 10: Comprehensive Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to verify that the styling migration maintains visual consistency and functionality, so that users experience no regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing before/after THEN visual regression tests SHALL pass for all components
2. WHEN testing responsive behavior THEN all breakpoints SHALL function identically to the original
3. WHEN validating accessibility THEN all WCAG compliance SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN checking performance THEN CSS bundle size SHALL not increase significantly
5. WHEN testing interactions THEN all hover, focus, and active states SHALL work correctly
